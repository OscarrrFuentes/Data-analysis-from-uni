Different data analysis programs for physics experiments done at Manchester University

I'm currently a first year undergraduate studying Physics at the Univervity of Manchester. Experiments and data analysis of the results are part of the course, so I need to write up codes (I use Python) to be able to do this efficiently. Thought it would be nice to have a record of some of the programs I'm most proud of.
